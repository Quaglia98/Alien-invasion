# Alien-invasion
2D Game developed with Python using library Pygame

A simple and famous game where you have to pilot a ship (using right/left mouse click) and shoot fleets of aliens (using space), which will move towards the ship.

Player has 3 ships, if there's a collision between a ship and an alien, or an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, the ship will explode.

Every time a player kill a fleet of aliens, another one will spawn but it will have an increased movement speed, there's a score and highscore system as well.

The game session ends when all the ships are destroyed.
